# Welcome to Hangman!

This is the second attempt at a hangman game that I made to learn basic Python. The game now contains four different difficulty levels:
- **Easy**
- **Medium**
- **Hard**
- **Scientific**

These are less levels of difficulty and more accurately represent the lengths of the words that are given with the shortest word being in Easy and the longest in Scientific.
